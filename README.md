## About the Video Course
Mobile-first is the perspective developers have to think from to meet the demand of creating modern applications which are highly connected, accessible, and built for longevity.

Ionic enters this space as a powerful SDK which leverages AngularJS and Apache Cordova to enable the development of applications which look and perform like native ones, written purely in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The value of Ionic for web developers is that grants the flexibility of developing mobile applications for major mobile platforms without getting into the complexity of working with native frameworks and languages.

Beginning Ionic Hybrid Application Development delivers your first steps into developing elegant, feature-rich cross-platform mobile applications with the framework, whilst taking advantage of its AngularJS backbone, and the Cordova API set.

We start off installing Ionic, exploring various commands such as start, serve, platform, run, and emulate, giving you a basic foundation of working with the Ionic CLI. We will then walk through built-in templates, themes, and headers, before creating an Ionic list, rendering data for it, and taking a look at creating services to manage our data efficiently.

Next, we start to incorporate greater sophistication by adding elements such as infinite scroll and pull-to-refresh, implementing data persistence, and focus on generally enhancing the user experience. Finally, we will talk about deploying our application to an emulator for testing purposes, and discuss Cordova plugins that can add even more functionality. By the end of the video you will have developed a full-featured, multi-platform mobile Ionic application.
